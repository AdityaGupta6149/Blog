**What is RWD and how does it improve mobile SEO?**

A responsive web design (RWD) helps strengthen your mobile content marketing strategy. RWD is the approach of creating a website that can adjust its viewing environment across devices, from large desktop displays to smartphone screens. No longer do you need a separate site optimized for mobile – you can simply use RWD to ensure your website is accessible and aesthetically pleasing no matter the device.

There are several reasons why RWD is vital to a healthy mobile SEO and content marketing strategy. First off, you only have to manage your content for one website. No longer do you have to manage a mobile-friendly version of your domain. As long as your content is unique, optimized and relevant, the site will be viewed (in the eyes of Google) the same way on a mobile device or a laptop. Secondly, one of the best qualities of RWD is that the SEO credibility and trust you develop through link building transfers from your desktop user experience to your mobile site. It is the exact same website, just viewed differently depending on which device your audiences are using.

**How to find out my website is mobile friendly or not?**

Well, you can simply use a tool called mobile-friendly test to find out your site is mobile friendly or not. Below is the link to this tool: [Mobile friendly check](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly)

**What is Google Mobile first Index?**

As more and more searches happen on mobile, Google wants its index and results to represent the majority of its users — who are mobile searchers.

Google has started to use the mobile version of the web as its primary search engine index. A search engine index is a collection of pages/documents that the search engine has discovered, primarily through crawling the web through links. Google has crawled the web from a desktop browser point of view, and now Google is changing that to crawl the web from a mobile browser view.

**Does content matter in Mobile SEO?**

Yes, content plays a major role in Mobile SEO as well. Below are listed below features of the content which help in improving the Mobile SEO:

1. **Content quality:** Factors such as newness and freshness to the content add a lot of value to SEO, if the content is unique and is not present in most of the competitor sites then the site ranking will be surely high.

2. **Content research/keyword research:** The most important SEO factor after creating good content is good keyword research. The content should be created using those keywords which users frequently use to find answers to the query on the topic or subject on which your website is based.

3. **Vertical search:** Vertical searches are searches which focus on covering one segment, a vertical slice of the overall interest rather than a broad range of interests.
For example: Google’s Image Search is an example of vertical search which focuses only on crawling images and not on text or other media and hence to improve the ranking of the website a huge focus should also be laid on Vertical search.

**How to configure site for multiple devices and help search engines understand your site?**

There are three main techniques for implementing a website that can handle view screens of all types and sizes. Here’s a chart comparing the three methods:

**Responsive web design:** Serves the same HTML code on the same URL regardless of the users’ device (desktop, tablet, mobile, non-visual browser), but can render the display differently (i.e., “respond”) based on the screen size. Responsive design is Google’s recommended design pattern.

**Dynamic serving:** Uses the same URL regardless of the device but generates a different version of HTML for different device types based on what the server knows about the user’s browser.

**Separate URLs:** Serves different code to each device, and on separate URLs. This configuration tries to detect the users’ device, then redirects to the appropriate page using HTTP redirects along with the Vary HTTP header.

Google does not favor any particular URL format as long as the page(s) and all page assets are accessible to all Googlebot user-agents.
